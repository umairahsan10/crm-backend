## 1. Create Production Unit

### Method and Endpoint
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Endpoint**: `/production/units`

### API Description and Flow
This API creates a new production unit in the system. The flow includes:
1. Validates all required fields using DTO validation
2. Checks if the employee (headId) exists in the database
3. Verifies that the employee has the `unit_head` role
4. Validates that the unit name is unique (not already exists)
5. Creates the production unit in the database
6. Returns success response

### Request Body
```json
{
  "name": "string (required)",
  "headId": "number (optional)"
}
```

**Required Fields:**
- `name`: Unit name (must be unique)
- `headId`: Employee ID who will be the unit head (optional)

### Response Format

**Success Response (201):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "New Production Unit Created Successfully"
}
```

**Error Responses:**

**Validation Errors (400):**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": [
    "Unit name is required",
    "Head ID must be a positive number"
  ],
  "error": "Bad Request"
}
```

**Business Logic Errors (400):**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "Employee with ID 123 does not exist",
  "error": "Bad Request"
}
```

```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "Employee must have unit_head role to be assigned as unit head",
  "error": "Bad Request"
}
```

**Conflict Errors (409):**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 409,
  "message": "Unit name already exists",
  "error": "Conflict"
}
```

```json
{
  "statusCode": 409,
  "message": "Employee John Doe (ID: 123) is already the head of production unit \"Unit B\" (ID: 2). Each employee can only be the head of one production unit at a time. Please remove this employee from their current unit first or choose a different employee.",
  "error": "Conflict"
}
```

### Validations
- `name`: Required string, not empty
- `headId`: Optional positive number
- Employee with `headId` must exist and have `unit_head` role

- Remove teams from units
- Projects remain linked to teams after removal

### **Role-Based Security**

- Consistent counting across all endpoints
- Teams show only team information (no project details)
- Projects are displayed separately in `allProjects` section

### Validations
- **Unit Validation**: Unit must exist in the database
- **Access Control**: Unit heads can only access their own unit
- **No request body validation required**

### Business Logic
1. **Unit Existence Check**: Validates that the unit exists
2. **Access Control**: 
   - `dep_manager` can access any unit
   - `unit_head` can only access their own unit (where they are the head)
3. **Data Retrieval**: Gets teams with team lead and current project details
4. **Data Formatting**: Returns formatted team information

### Database Operations

**Tables Accessed:**
- `sales_units` table (read - for unit validation)
- `teams` table (read - for team data)
- `employees` table (read - for team lead details)
- `projects` table (read - for current project details)

**Database Changes:**
- **No changes** - read-only operation

**Database Queries:**
1. **SELECT** from `sales_units` for unit validation
2. **SELECT** from `teams` with JOINs to `employees` and `projects`
3. **WHERE** salesUnitId = provided unit ID
4. **ORDER BY** name ascending

### Access Control
- **Authentication**: JWT token required
- **Roles**: `dep_manager` or `unit_head` role required
- **Departments**: `Sales` department required
- **Admin Access**: Admins (admin, supermanager) have automatic access
- **Unit Head Access**: âœ… **ALLOWED** - Can access their own unit only

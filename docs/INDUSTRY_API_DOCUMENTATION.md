## üìä Database Tables Affected

### Primary Table
- **`industries`**: Main industry records

### Related Tables
- **`clients`**: Has `industryId` foreign key
- **`cracked_leads`**: Has `industryId` foreign key

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### 1. Unique Name Constraint
- **Field**: `name` in `industries` table
- **Type**: `VARCHAR(150)` with UNIQUE constraint
- **Validation**: Case-insensitive uniqueness check
- **Example**: "Technology" and "technology" are considered duplicates

### 2. Soft Delete vs Hard Delete
- **Soft Delete (Recommended)**: Sets `isActive = false`, preserves all data
- **Hard Delete**: Permanently removes from database, only allowed if no dependencies
- **Best Practice**: Always use soft delete for industries in production

### 3. Dependencies
- **Clients**: Can be associated with an industry
- **Cracked Leads**: Must have an industry when created
- **Deletion**: Blocked if any dependencies exist

### 4. Active Industries
- **Default**: New industries are created with `isActive = true`
- **Dropdowns**: Only active industries appear in frontend dropdowns
- **Filtering**: Both active and inactive can be viewed with filters

### 5. Pagination
- **Default Limit**: 20 items per page
- **Maximum**: No hard limit, but recommended to keep under 100
- **Performance**: Queries are optimized with proper indexing

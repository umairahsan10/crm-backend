# üéØ Lead Management API Documentation

## Overview
Complete API documentation for the Lead Management System. This system handles the entire lead lifecycle from creation to completion, including role-based access control, business logic automation, and comprehensive audit trails.

---

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### Guards
- **`JwtAuthGuard`**: Ensures user is authenticated
- **`LeadsAccessGuard`**: Restricts access to Sales, HR, Admin, and Marketing users only
- **`LeadCreationGuard`**: Restricts lead creation to Sales team and Admin users only
- **`ArchivedLeadsAccessGuard`**: Restricts archived leads access to authorized users

### Role-Based Access Matrix

| User Type | Create Leads | Access Leads | Lead Types Visible | Scope of Access |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Sales Team** | ‚úÖ YES | ‚úÖ YES | All types | Based on role hierarchy |
| **HR**         | ‚ùå NO  | ‚úÖ YES | All types | Read-only access     |
| **Admin**      | ‚úÖ YES | ‚úÖ YES | All types | All units, all leads |
| **Marketing**  | ‚ùå NO  | ‚úÖ YES | All types | Limited access       |
| **Production** | ‚ùå NO  | ‚ùå NO  | None      | No access            |
| **Finance**    | ‚ùå NO  | ‚ùå NO  | None      | No access            |

### üèóÔ∏è Hierarchical Lead Access Control

The system implements a sophisticated hierarchical access control system based on sales department structure:

#### **Department Manager (dep_manager)**
- **Scope**: All leads from all sales units
- **Lead Types**: warm, cold, push, upsell
- **Restrictions**: None - full access

#### **Unit Head (unit_head)**
- **Scope**: All leads from their sales unit only
- **Lead Types**: warm, cold, push, upsell
- **Restrictions**: Cannot see leads from other units

#### **Team Lead (team_lead)**
- **Scope**: All leads from their sales unit + leads assigned to their team members
- **Lead Types**: warm, cold, push, upsell
- **Restrictions**: Cannot see leads from other units or other teams
- **Special**: Includes leads assigned to themselves

#### **Senior (senior)**
- **Scope**: Only leads assigned to them from their sales unit
- **Lead Types**: warm, cold, push
- **Restrictions**: Cannot see leads assigned to others

#### **Junior (junior)**
- **Scope**: Only leads assigned to them from their sales unit
- **Lead Types**: warm, cold
- **Restrictions**: Cannot see leads assigned to others, no push/upsell access

#### **Admin**
- **Scope**: All leads from all sales units
- **Lead Types**: warm, cold, push, upsell
- **Restrictions**: None - full access

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Database Relationships
The hierarchical access control system uses the following database relationships:

- **`employees`** table: Contains user information and `team_lead_id` field
- **`sales_department`** table: Links employees to sales units
- **`sales_units`** table: Contains unit information and `head_id` field
- **`teams`** table: Contains team information and `team_lead_id` field

### Access Control Logic
1. **User Authentication**: JWT token contains user ID and role
2. **Sales Department Lookup**: System queries `sales_department` table to get user's sales unit
3. **Hierarchical Filtering**: Based on role, applies appropriate WHERE clauses:
   - **Team Lead**: Queries team members via `team_lead_id` relationship
   - **Unit Head**: Filters by `sales_unit_id`
   - **Senior/Junior**: Filters by `assigned_to_id = user_id`
4. **Type Filtering**: Additional filtering based on role permissions
5. **Database Query**: Single optimized query with conditional joins

### Performance Optimizations
- **Single Query**: All filtering done in one database query
- **Conditional Joins**: Only joins necessary tables based on role
- **Indexed Fields**: All filter fields are properly indexed
- **Pagination**: Built-in pagination to handle large datasets

### Update Permissions
- **Assignment-Based**: Users can only update leads **assigned to them**
- **No Hierarchical Override**: Even managers/team leads cannot update subordinates' leads
- **Exception**: System-level operations (archiving, auto-upsell) bypass this restriction

### 5. Request Leads (Get Leads)
**`POST /leads/request`**

Allows salespersons to request leads. Implements the "Getting Leads" workflow with support for keeping existing leads and including push leads.

#### Request Body
```json
{
  "keptLeadIds": [1, 2, 3],
  "includePushLeads": true
}
```

#### Request Fields
- `keptLeadIds` (optional): Array of lead IDs to keep from existing assigned leads
- `includePushLeads` (optional): Boolean to include push leads in assignment (default: false)

#### Workflow
1. **Validate User**: Checks user has sales department record
2. **Circulate Leads**: Non-kept leads are returned to the pool (status = "new", assignedTo = null)
3. **Count Current**: Counts currently kept leads
4. **Calculate Need**: Determines how many new leads needed (total 10)
5. **Assign New**: Assigns new leads based on `includePushLeads` flag:
   - If `true`: Gets 8 warm/cold + 2 push leads
   - If `false`: Gets 10 warm/cold leads only
6. **Update Status**: New leads get status "in_progress"

#### Response
```json
{
  "assignedLeads": [
    {
      "id": 6,
      "name": "New Lead",
      "type": "warm",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "assignedTo": {
        "firstName": "Jane",
        "lastName": "Smith"
      },
      "salesUnit": {
        "name": "North Region"
      }
    }
  ],
  "keptLeads": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Existing Lead",
      "type": "warm",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "assignedTo": {
        "firstName": "Jane",
        "lastName": "Smith"
      },
      "salesUnit": {
        "name": "North Region"
      }
    }
  ],
  "totalActiveLeads": 10,
  "circulatedLeads": 2,
  "leadBreakdown": {
    "warmColdLeads": 8,
    "pushLeads": 2,
    "totalAssigned": 7
  },
  "includePushLeads": true
}
```

### 6. Update Lead (Main API)
**`PUT /leads/:id`**

Main API for updating leads with complex business logic. Handles all lead modifications including outcome, status, and special actions.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Users can only update leads **assigned to them**. Even managers/team leads cannot update subordinates' leads.

#### Request Body Examples

##### A. Update Outcome (Requires Comment)
```json
{
  "outcome": "interested",
  "comment": "Customer showed strong interest in our services. Scheduled follow-up call for next week."
}
```

##### B. Update Status to "cracked" (Requires Cracked Lead Fields)
```json
{
  "status": "cracked",
  "comment": "Lead successfully converted! Customer signed contract.",
  "totalAmount": 50000,
  "industryId": 1,
  "description": "Enterprise software solution for manufacturing",
  "totalPhases": 3,
  "currentPhase": 1
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: 
- **DO NOT** send `commission` field - it is auto-calculated from sales department
- Commission rate is automatically fetched from the user's `sales_department` record

##### C. Update Status to "completed"
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "comment": "Project completed successfully. All deliverables met."
}
```

##### D. Push Lead (Makes it available to higher roles)
```json
{
  "action": "push",
  "comment": "Lead needs senior sales rep attention. Customer has complex requirements."
}
```

##### E. Mark as "denied" (Tests failed lead logic)
```json
{
  "outcome": "denied",
  "comment": "Customer not interested. Budget constraints mentioned."
}
```

#### Business Logic Implemented

##### Outcome Updates
- **Comment Required**: Comment is mandatory when updating outcome
- **History Created**: Creates record in `lead_outcome_history`
- **Failed Lead Handling**: Increments `failedCount` on "denied" outcome
- **Archiving**: At 4 failed attempts, lead is moved to `archive_leads`

##### Status Updates
- **History Created**: Creates record in `lead_outcome_history`
- **Cracked Lead Creation**: When status = "cracked" AND outcome = "interested"
  - Validates: `industryId` is required
  - Validates: `totalAmount` is required
  - Auto-fetches: Commission rate from sales department
  - Creates: `cracked_lead` record
  - Resets: `failedCount` to 0
- **Auto-Upsell**: When status = "completed", type becomes "upsell"
- **Commission Update**: Updates commission rate from sales department
- **Team Statistics**: Updates team's completed leads count

##### Push Action
- **Type Change**: Changes type to "push"
- **Status Reset**: Resets status to "new"
- **Unassign**: Removes assignment (assignedToId = null)
- **Outcome Clear**: Clears outcome (outcome = null)
- **History**: Creates audit trail

#### Response
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "outcome": "interested",
  "status": "cracked",
  "type": "warm",
  "assignedTo": {

```bash
# Create lead ‚Üí Request leads ‚Üí Update outcome ‚Üí Complete ‚Üí Upsell
# Test failed lead logic (4 denied attempts ‚Üí archived)
# Test cracked lead creation with auto-commission
# Test push action and role restrictions
# Test payment link generation and completion
```
